# About
This project was aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to predict consequences and impact of extreme weather events. The project was part of my coursework of Machine Learning Specialization by CareerFoundry. ClimateWIn is an European nonprofit organization interested in using machine learning to help predict consequences of climate change. In this project we have used several supervised machine learning algorithms to predict pleasant or unpleasant days for outdoor activities and we have assesed which algorithm best work for this goal.

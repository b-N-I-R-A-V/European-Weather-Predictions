# European Weather Prediction
This project was aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to predict consequences and impact of extreme weather events. The project was part of my coursework of Machine Learning Specialization by CareerFoundry. In this project we have used several machine learning algorithms to predict pleasant or unpleasant days for outdoor activities and we have assesed which algorithm best work for this goal.

## Tools and Techniques
* Python (Ski-kit Learn Library: K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Decision Trees, Artifical Neural Network (ANN))
* Scaling Data to improve model performance
* Gradient Descent method for predicting temperature

## Project Hypotheses
* Machine learning can accurately predict historical extreme temperatures using temperature data from stations across Europe.
* Supervised machine learning models can predict the likelihood of extreme weather events based on historical data.
* Machine learning models can be used to predict whether weather conditions on a given day will be favorable or unfavorable for outdoor activities.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project comes from European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D). They have robost data quality and homogeneity procedures to ensure data reliability and data consistency. The data contained in the dataset is between the year 1960-2022. This data is provided by various participating instituions across Europe. 

### Challenges with the Dataset
For the most recent data, there could be error present as it might not have been through proper validation processes. Further, there might be concerns around instrument malfunction or calibration errors present in the data. But considering the fact that they resolve any error which could be present in the historical data and the quality measures in place, this is the best dataset that we can have.

# About
This project was aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to predict consequences and impact of extreme weather events. The project was part of my coursework of Machine Learning Specialization by CareerFoundry. In this project we have used several supervised machine learning algorithms to predict pleasant or unpleasant days for outdoor activities and we have assesed which algorithm best work for this goal.

## Tools and Techniques
* Python (Ski-kit Learn Library: K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Decision Trees, Artifical Neural Network (ANN))
* Scaling Data to improve model performance
* Gradient Descent method for predicting temperature
